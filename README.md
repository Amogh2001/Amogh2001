Hello! 

My name is Amogh Sanjay and I am a fourth year mechanical engineering student at B.M.S College of Engineering, Bangalore.

I am interested in scientific computing and numerical methods as well as applying these concepts in the fields of fluid mechanics and climate modelling.

I am excited to learn new concepts and to share my code with others.

Thanks for reading! ❤
